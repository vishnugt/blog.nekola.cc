Hey there! I’m someone who loves getting lost in the worlds of *Japanese movies and dramas* — their storytelling always feels so immersive and heartfelt. I also have a soft spot for Korean dramas; they have a way of pulling you in and never letting go! When I’m not exploring these cinematic worlds, I’m usually adventuring in *Genshin Impact*, my absolute favorite game. There’s something magical about roaming beautiful landscapes, taking on exciting quests, and immersing myself in the intricate lore and absolutely lovable characters.

I’m a tech enthusiast at heart, always drawn to gadgets and innovations, but what really excites me is crafting *aesthetic* setups and themes. There’s something so satisfying about creating a space or vibe that feels just right. I also watch *anime* occasionally, adding a bit of adventure and wonder to my downtime.

Recently, I’ve taken on a new challenge: learning *Japanese*! It’s been such a rewarding journey so far, and I’m dreaming of the day I can curl up with a Japanese novel and read it in its original language. If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to connect and chat about all things gaming, dramas, tech, or even swap language-learning tips!

You may also find me around as Nek, Neko/Neki, Nekola, Nekarc, Lime, or Troublesome-Cat!
