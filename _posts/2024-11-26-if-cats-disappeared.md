There are some stories that resonate so deeply they become a part of you, and for me, *If Cats Disappeared from the World* is one of them. This Japanese film has captured my heart not just for its poignant narrative, but for the way it gently reminds us of life's impermanence and the quiet joys we often overlook.

It's not merely a movie I admire — it's my most favorite movie of all time. So much so that I've set a personal goal: to one day read its original Japanese version. I'm actively learning the language, partly inspired by this desire, hoping to experience the story in the words its author, Genki Kawamura, originally penned. I believe doing so will deepen my connection to the film, allowing me to uncover layers of meaning and nuance that might be lost in translation.

This isn't just a story about cats; it's a story about what it means to live, love, and let go.

## A Deal with the Devil

The premise is deceptively simple yet profound. The story follows a young postman who discovers he has a terminal illness. Just as he begins to grapple with his mortality, the Devil appears with a sinister bargain: he can extend his life by one day for every item he agrees to erase from the world.

What begins with seemingly trivial objects like phones and clocks gradually escalates to even removing cats from existence. Each choice forces the protagonist to confront the value of what he's giving up and what these things mean to the people around him.

Cats in the film are more than just adorable companions. They symbolize the unspoken ties between people, representing comfort, love, and nostalgia. The protagonist's cat, Cabbage, acts as a bridge to his late mother, a connection to his past, and a silent witness to his lonely life.

When the prospect of erasing cats arises, the protagonist is forced to confront what truly matters. The film delicately explores how the things we take for granted — whether an animal, a memory, or a shared moment — anchor us to our humanity.

## Themes That Linger

*If Cats Disappeared from the World* lingers in the mind long after the credits roll, its themes weaving a tapestry of introspection:

**The Fragility of Life:** The film doesn't shy away from the inevitability of death. Instead, it asks us to reflect on how we spend our time and who we choose to share it with.

**The Cost of Convenience:** By erasing objects like phones and clocks, the protagonist experiences both freedom and isolation. The story subtly critiques our dependence on modern conveniences, urging us to reevaluate what we truly need.

**The Weight of Loss:** With every disappearance, a void is left behind. The film explores how absence shapes our understanding of presence, teaching us that love and loss are two sides of the same coin.

> When you lose something, you realize just how much you needed it. And sometimes, you never get the chance to say goodbye.

## A Cinematic Masterpiece

Visually, the film is breathtaking. Director Akira Nagai crafts a visually stunning film, using muted tones and intimate framing to convey the protagonist's introspection and create an atmosphere of quiet reflection. The cat, Cabbage, is a scene-stealer, its quiet presence underscoring moments of tenderness and sorrow. The performances, particularly by Takeru Satoh as the protagonist and the Devil, bring depth and charm to this introspective tale.

## My Personal Take

This movie isn't just a story — it's a reminder to cherish the fleeting moments of life. It doesn't offer easy answers, and that's precisely what makes it so impactful. It asks us to sit with uncomfortable truths, contemplate the impermanence of everything we hold dear, and find meaning in our everyday lives.

For me, *If Cats Disappeared from the World* is more than a favorite movie — it's a guiding light. It's inspired me not only to reflect on my own life but also to embark on a journey of learning Japanese so I can experience the story in its purest form.

## Final Thoughts

This is a film for anyone who has ever loved, lost, or wondered what makes life truly meaningful. Its themes of connection, sacrifice, and acceptance resonate universally, making it a bittersweet yet profoundly beautiful experience.

If you've ever found yourself wondering what you'd give up — or what you'd fight to keep — this movie will speak to you.
