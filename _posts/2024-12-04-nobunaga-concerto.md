How does an ordinary high school student transform into one of Japan's most iconic historical figures? Nobunaga Concerto, the 2014 live-action series and its follow-up movie, answers this question with humor, heart, and surprising depth. Based on Ayumi Ishii's manga, the story chronicles Saburo's accidental journey to the Sengoku era, where he must assume the role of Oda Nobunaga and navigate the challenges of leadership, war, and relationships.

At its core, Nobunaga Concerto is a story of transformation — not just of history, but of Saburo himself. This blog explores how the series portrays his growth from a reluctant impostor to a leader capable of inspiring those around him, all while forging profound connections with the characters around him. Among the many relationships Saburo forms, his evolving bonds with Kicho and Tsuneoki stand out the most to me.

## Saburo's Growth

Saburo's journey begins with his characteristic modern-day carelessness. Thrust into the role of Nobunaga, he is initially overwhelmed by the weight of his responsibilities and the brutal reality of the Sengoku era. His reliance on instinct and a desire to protect those he cares about often leads to unorthodox solutions that both confound and endear him to those around him. As he reluctantly steps into Nobunaga's role, his lack of strategy and historical knowledge often leads to humorous, if not disastrous, results. Yet, beneath his clumsiness lies a surprising strength: his compassion and ability to see people as individuals rather than pawns in a political game.

Over time, the weight of his responsibilities pushes Saburo to mature. He learns to think beyond himself, understanding the larger implications of his actions. Importantly, his transformation isn't a sudden, heroic leap but a gradual process filled with setbacks, self-doubt, and moments of quiet realization. By the end of the series and movie, Saburo emerges not as the historical Nobunaga we know but as a leader defined by his unique blend of modern values and a growing sense of duty.


## Kicho

Saburo's relationship with Kicho, Nobunaga's wife, reflects the series' emotional core. Initially, Kicho views him with suspicion and frustration. To her, Saburo's odd behavior and unconventional methods are a poor match for the role of a feudal lord. However, as she witnesses his earnest attempts to protect his people and those close to him, her perspective shifts.

Kicho's gradual trust and eventual partnership with Saburo highlight her own development as well. From a figure bound by the constraints of her era, she becomes a steadfast ally, choosing to support Saburo not because of his title but because of the person he grows to be. By the movie's conclusion, their relationship stands as a testament to mutual respect and shared purpose, transcending the roles they were forced into.


## Tsuneoki

Tsuneoki's journey with Saburo begins in a place of cautious loyalty. As Nobunaga's trusted retainer, he is committed to supporting his lord but is often bewildered by Saburo's eccentricities. Early interactions between the two are marked by tension as Tsuneoki struggles to reconcile Saburo's seemingly frivolous approach with the high stakes of their world.

What makes Tsuneoki's relationship with Saburo so compelling is the subtle shift from obligation to genuine camaraderie. Over time, Tsuneoki comes to see Saburo not as an impostor but as a leader who, despite his unconventional ways, genuinely cares for those around him. Their growing bond is one of the most rewarding arcs in the series, showcasing how respect and friendship can overcome even the most profound differences.


## My Final Thoughts

Nobunaga Concerto is far more than a historical drama or a time-travel tale — it’s a story of growth, resilience, and the power of relationships. Saburo’s transformation from a carefree teenager to a reluctant yet capable leader is a journey filled with humor, heartache, and triumph. Among the many relationships he forms, his bonds with Kicho and Tsuneoki are especially compelling to me because they highlight his humanity and the depth of his growth as a leader. Their evolution from skepticism to mutual trust and respect adds an emotional richness that stays with you long after the story ends.

Watching Nobunaga Concerto reminded me of the importance of relationships in shaping who we are. The humor and heartfelt moments made this series and movie an unforgettable experience — one I’d gladly revisit.
